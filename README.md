## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Spacing is very much complicated to me. It is important to maintain proper spacing using CSS. Card text warping is not working for me using flex box wrap property. Then line break `<br>` are found helpful to slice down the text content into pieces.

Figma design related guide and Git related learning is very much helpful. Thanks to **Frontend Mentor** for written guidance.

### Continued development

CSS proper spacing and HTML nested structure limiting techniques.

### Useful resources
